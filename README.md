# Python-Discord-Screenshot-Bot
- This discord bot allows the user to take a screenshot of his/her browser and upload it to a discord chat (using the Python Selenium module in order to connect itself to the user's browser and take images)
- You can try out the discord bot by downloading the repository and running the python file
- Feel free to insert your discord bot's token in the "TOKEN" area
- In order to make the discord bot function properly, please change the "CHROME DRIVER LOCATION" text to the location of your chrome driver (which should be located inside of your Python directory) and "SCREENSHOT SAVE LOCATION" to the folder where you'd like the screenshots to save
